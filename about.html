                        <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
                        <p class="lead-text">For over a decade, I've operated at the intersection of operations, data, and systems design, strengthening inventory, financial performance, labor planning, facilities, and team enablement.</p>
                        
                        <p>My work began on the floor—forecasting demand, aligning labor, managing assets, and supporting people—and evolved into building digital tools, automated workflows, and data-driven applications that remove friction and improve clarity.</p>
                        
                        <p>I bring a strong work ethic, deep operational empathy, and a commitment to clean, dependable systems—whether supporting internal teams, building SaaS platforms, or delivering client-facing automation.</p>

                                <p>I understand the daily challenges teams face because I've lived them—inefficient processes, disconnected systems, and manual work that doesn't scale.</p>

                            <p>When I'm not building systems, I'm often experimenting with personal projects that solve problems I encounter in daily life. My <strong>Dishboard</strong> project came from frustration with cluttered recipe websites, while <strong>AutoBalance</strong> grew from wanting better visibility into personal finances without cloud dependencies.</p>
                            
                            <p>I believe the best solutions often come from understanding problems deeply and personally. This philosophy carries through everything I build—whether it's a SaaS platform for facility management or an internal tool for labor forecasting.</p>
                            
                            <p>I value deep work, clear communication, and building things that matter. Remote collaboration suits me well, allowing for the focused problem-solving that complex operational challenges require.</p>
