                        <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <p>For over a decade, I've operated at the intersection of operations, data, and systems design, strengthening inventory, financial performance, labor planning, facilities, and team enablement.</p>

                            <p>My work began on the floor—forecasting demand, aligning labor, managing assets, and supporting people—and evolved into building digital tools, automated workflows, and data-driven applications that remove friction and improve clarity.</p>
                            
                            <p>I bring a strong work ethic, deep operational empathy, and a commitment to clean, dependable systems—whether supporting internal teams, building SaaS platforms, or delivering client-facing automation.</p>
                            
                            <p>My development approach combines strategic architecture thinking with modern AI assistance. I leverage LLMs and AI tools to accelerate development while maintaining the personal touch and operational understanding that drives effective solutions. Rather than getting lost in language specifics, I focus on system design and user needs, using AI to enhance my capabilities without sacrificing the human insight that makes technology truly valuable.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>What Drives My Work</h3>
                        <ul class="about-list">
                            <li><strong>Operational Empathy:</strong> I understand the daily challenges teams face because I've lived them—inefficient processes, disconnected systems, and manual work that doesn't scale.</li>
                            <li><strong>Systems Thinking:</strong> Every solution I build is grounded in real operational constraints, designed to support people's judgment rather than replace it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Practical Excellence:</strong> Good systems should feel invisible while providing the structure and automation teams need to operate effectively.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reliable Delivery:</strong> I focus on creating solutions that work consistently, integrate smoothly, and remain maintainable over time.</li>

                            <p>I believe the best solutions often come from understanding problems deeply and personally. This philosophy carries through everything I build—whether it's a SaaS platform for facility management or an internal tool for labor forecasting.</p>
