                    <p>
                        My background in operations leadership provided deep insight into the daily challenges teams face—inefficient processes, disconnected systems, and manual work that scales poorly. This experience shaped my transition into software development, analytics, and automation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I approach every project with an emphasis on reliability, attention to detail, and practical system design. The goal is always to create solutions that work consistently, integrate smoothly with existing workflows, and remain maintainable over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My work is grounded in the understanding that good systems should feel invisible to users while providing the structure and automation teams need to operate effectively.
